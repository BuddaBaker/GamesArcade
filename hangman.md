# Hangman 

Welcome to the Hangman page! Click on the play button to generate a new word for you to guess! 

## How to Play

For those who are unfamiliar with Hangman or have forgotten how to play it, below are the rules:

- Every round, a new word will be randomly generated for you to guess
- You have 7 chances to guess the mystery word as fast as possible
- Every time you guess a letter correctly, the letters that were in the word will be crossed out/removed from the word bank
- If you guess a letter wrong, you lose one life
- Good luck!
