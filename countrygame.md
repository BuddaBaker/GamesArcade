# Guess the Country!
### How to Play
Our random country generator will give you a random letter, one for each country beginning with that letter. When you click go, you will see a certain amount of spaces to type words into. Within a given amount of time for a countdown, you need to enter each correct country into one box - abbreviation will not be accepted. If a nonexistent country or a country not beginning with the letter is entered, you will be let know of that. You will also know if you have guessed a correct country. You will know the correct answers after the time runs out.
